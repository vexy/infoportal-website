Website location: https://infoportal.app

> Current version: `1.3.1`

## TechStack
Platform is made using `SvelteKit` and `TypeScript`. It uses `node 20.x` as a runtime engine.

To get the website running locally, run:  
```bash
$ npm install  # wait to complete
$ npm run dev
```  

To build for `production` use (typical):
```bash
$ npm run build
```

Platform uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as the general backend system, but it can use any SQL backed processing engine. Check [this helper class](/src/lib/QuestionsService.ts) for more info.
